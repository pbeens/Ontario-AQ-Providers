# AQ Providers in Ontario, Canada

Welcome to this "communal" list of AQ providers in Ontario. I have created this as a resource for teachers that can be edited and maintained by anyone.

This first version has been created to solicit feedback on the fields I'll be using for each AQ Provider. Please see the [Template](#template) section and let me know if you have any recommended changes before I start entering the other providers. You can either [email me](mailto:pbeens@gmail.com) with your proposed changes or use the Issues tab above.
